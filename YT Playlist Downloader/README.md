# Youtube Playlist Downloader

This is a minor utility Python script that I have written to help automate and simplify the process of downloading audio/mp3 files from a YouTube playlist

## Guide
1. Make sure that the YouTube playlist you want to download is made 'Public'.

   [The program will not download a video if it is 'Unavailable in your country' or 'Unlisted']
   
3. Copy the URL and paste it in the provided field.

4. Click 'Download' and wait for the magic to happen.

5. Once completed, the downloaded files will be located in a 'Downloads' folder, in the same location as the Python script.

## Improvements
- A more attractive and appealing interface.
- The ability to see the specific download status for each video in more precise details.
- Inform the user on the details of an error both internal and external, and steps to solve it.
